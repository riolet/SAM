Should the details pane respect the timerange and port filter?
  Timerange is respected.
  Filter is ignored.
added tests for pages/details.py
ammended tests for dbaccess.py get_details to cover ports and timeranges

fixed several bugs while writing test cases.
finished writing test cases for dbaccess.py
added tests for common.py
added tests for server.py
added tests for pages/map.py
added tests for pages/nodes.py
added tests for pages/links.py

updated README for asa and aws importers
split server.py into server and wsgiserver.py for deployment
started test cases covering dbaccess.py;
  rewrote get_links_* functions

Tried a new schema:
    Nodes ((ip, subnet)[PK], ip_range, x, y, radius, alias)
    Ports (port[PK], active, name, description)
    PortAlias (port[PK/FK], name, description)
    Links (id[PK], (src_address, subnet)[FK], (dest_address, subnet)[FK], port[FK])
    Links8 ((link_id[FK], timestamp)[PK], count)
    Links16 ((link_id[FK], timestamp)[PK], count)
    Links24 ((link_id[FK], timestamp)[PK], count)
    Links32 ((link_id[FK], timestamp)[PK], count)
Issues:
    Keeping the ip as a 32-bit integer is confusing for the developer/maintainer.
        It slows down testing, in the absence of an easy translation
        It must be translated back and forth between display and representation
    No substantial speed up of anything.
    Calculating links was even more complex
        (Aggregating links between /24 destinations and other /16 or /8 sources)
    Could not easily determine number of unique connections for details panel
    SQL queries all required joins (not abstracted by web.py) which lock us further into MySQL
Benefits:
    Added foreign keys help guarantee db consistency
    Fewer columns in primary keys,
        This is from collapsing (ip8, ip16, ip24, ip32) into (ip, subnet)
    Links positioning reverted to client-side
        Reduced duplicate information (many x/y pairs in links tables)
        Reduced response size (not having 2 x 10-digit numbers being trasmitted per link)
Decision:
    Did not finish full conversion. Many program were still broken.
    Benefits did not outweigh issues in my understanding.  Testing did not reveal any significant gains.
    Decided against this change.
    Yay for version control branches.

Searching for a node by address should select that node too.
Timerange is now factored into link searches
Details will be purged when time range is changed.
Details panel should show data that:
    has NOT been filtered by port number
    but HAS been filtered by time range.
Details is slow (stats from 1 test):
    2ms   JS Select function to AJAX query
    29ms  Transit AJAX query to Python GET page
    397ms Python SQL queries
    1ms   Python SQL processing
    5ms   Transit Python response back to JS
    6ms   Response to updating DOM
    11ms  Finished updating DOM

Decided to use premade slider noUiSlider instead ( http://refreshless.com/nouislider/ )
    It is free and open source, no attribution necessary
    It can move sliders, handle dates, link the sliders, fire events, and is smooth with the mouse.
    Integrated into the config menu of the map.
CANCELED: Custom time range controller
    X mouse down:
    X    A = nearest handle
    X    move A to mouse.
    X    trigger edit event.
    X mouse drag:
    X    B = furthest handle
    X    move B to mouse.
    X    trigger edit event.
    X mouse up:
    X    trigger changed event

Links will be loaded seperate from nodes
    this allows nodes to be retained and links to be changed (with changing timelines)
    This also allows control over how links are loaded. (order of loading, chunking the requests)
    Changing filters now merely deletes links, and requests new links
        instead of deleting everything and reseting the view
Loading order started:
    nodes are ranked by distance from center of screen
    but nodes that are on screen and larger take priority
        (like if you're zoomed in on 12.34.56 then 12 and 12.34 would take priority)

Started adding timestamps.
    Decided not to add timestamps to `Node*` tables. Nodes are independent of time?
        If nothing is connecting to a node, it can just not be displayed.
        Nodes at different times won't need different names.
    ? Should `Nodes*` not store number-of-children precalculated if therewill be a potentially changing number?
    Links will have timestamps, quantized to 5 minute intervals.
        12 time slots per hour
        288 time slots per day
        2016 time slots per week (2016 is not a typo)
        105120 time slots per year
    Chose TIMESTAMP over DATETIME for format:
        stamps will be now-ish, not arbirary like appointments or birthdays
        timestamps are 32-bit (vs 64-bit for datetime) => faster, lighter
        Not quite sure what to do about timezones, but timestamps will do it right on the MySQL side
            (if I do it correctly on the python side)
Considering continuous import problem.
    Keep Syslog table as exclusive of batch import via import scripts
    Add two new buffer tables.  One to receive new imports. One to hold while processing for display.
    Buffers swap every 5 minutes. There needs to be some way to invoke the processing function. Not sure yet.
    Stats page will need to be different, or just not based on `Syslog`
